## Project Statement
This project aims at reduce the cost of public transportation via Taxi/Cab by having people who are headed in the same direction
spilt cost among the passengers

## Project Overview

-This ride-sharing system is designed to provide an affordable and efficient transportation solution for people in Rwanda. Similar to Uber Pool, the platform enables multiple passengers to share a single ride if they are traveling in the same direction.
 The system includes functionalities for user registration (passengers and drivers), vehicle management, ride creation, seat booking, payment processing, and ride fare estimation. It ensures data integrity and operational control through PL/SQL procedures, functions, and triggers. The system also includes auditing features to monitor restricted data changes on weekdays and public holidays.
 All database logic and operations are implemented using Oracle Database with PL/SQL, simulating a real-world backend for a ride-sharing application tailored to local needs.

## Project Objectives

- To provide an affordable ride-sharing solution tailored to the Rwandan market
- To enable passengers to book shared rides and split costs based on location and timing
- To optimize vehicle usage and increase driver earnings through pooled rides
- To implement secure, efficient backend logic using Oracle PL/SQL
- To track and audit user activity for accountability and transparency

## Advantages of the System

- **Affordability**: Passengers save money by sharing rides with others traveling the same route
- **Efficiency**: Drivers utilize their time and vehicle capacity better
- **Security & Control**: Triggers and auditing protect data from unauthorized or inappropriate changes
- **Automation**: PL/SQL procedures automate ride booking, fare estimation, and restrictions
- **Scalability**: The system can easily expand to include more features or serve other cities

## Technologies Used

- **Oracle Database 21c** – for relational data storage and management
- **PL/SQL** – to implement backend business logic including:
  - Procedures and functions for booking and fare estimation
  - Triggers for enforcing business rules and auditing
  - Cursors for fetching and displaying ride data
- **SQL*Plus** – for command-line interaction with the Oracle database
- **Draw.io** and **BPMN.io** – for creating ER diagrams and BPMN models
- **GitHub** – for version control and report submission
